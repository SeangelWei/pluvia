Pluvia
======

You can just load the project into you IDEA. Not sure if it work with Eclipse without any changes.

Pluvia will be a casual game where you will have to shoot balls.  Aim of the game is it to shoot all the balls. You will be able to score points and buy with them new upgrades.  Idea came from Bubble Trouble.
